# Mobile First Web App

This is a mobile first web app built with Next.js.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To be able to use the blob storage on local you will have to run the following command:

```bash
vercel env pull
```

> Notice that on local the onUploadCompleted won't succeed as Vercel Blob cannot contact localhost. (use Ngrok to expose your localhost to the internet)

First, run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```
